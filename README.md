# 👋 Hi, I'm Khy Phat

### Full-Stack Software Engineer | Final Year CS Student | Enterprise Solutions & Responsive Design

I am a strategic-thinking Software Engineer with a mastery of enterprise ecosystems. I specialize in bridging the gap between complex backend architectures (Node.js, ColdFusion) and intuitive, performant frontends (Vue, Ionic). Currently, I balance my time between finishing my degree and solving real-world problems.
